need an ecomerce app for selling where the babies can sleep
instead of designing the figma im taking another approach is to build the UI with HTML & TAIWIND
the page needed:
home page => 
  hero section with search input
  testimial
  partenaire
  best product
  footer
list product =>
  advanced filter
  list product
basket sidebar
checkout page

the UIs need to contains minimalist code js that when clicking in a button it goes to the next step
for each page create a component that contains mostly the code html with tailwind and the needed function to navigate


first enhance this prompt in a new file named prompt-advanced, then always save your progression there , when you back you can continue
